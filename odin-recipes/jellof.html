        <h2>PREPARATION</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Blend your tomatoes, red pepper, scotch bonnet peppers in a food processor<br> or blender for about 45 seconds, make sure that everything is blended well.</li>
            <li>In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is heated add the onions you set aside and fry just until they turn golden brown.</li>
            <li>Once the onions, have turned brown in color add the tomato paste and fry for 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Then add the blended tomato mixture (reserve about 1/4 cup and set aside) and<br> fry the mixture with the onions and tomato paste for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Make sure you stir consistently so that the tomato mixture does not burn.</li>
            <li>After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, and add the chicken stock.</li>
            <li>Mix and add your seasonings (salt, curry powder, thyme, all purpose seasoning, and the Knorr stock cube).</li>
            <li>Continue to boil for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the parboiled rice to the pot and mix it very well with the tomato stew. </li>
            <li>At this point if you need to add water so that the rice is level with the tomato mixture/chicken stock go ahead and do so. </li>
            <li>Add the bay leaves, cover the pot, and cook on medium to low heat for 15-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the liquid has almost dried up add the remaining tomato stew, cover, and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes<br> heat until the liquid has completely dried up.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat, mix thoroughly, and your Jollof Rice is ready to be eaten!</li>
